## 1	Basic Information

**Project Name:** *A Differential Privacy Encrypted Communication Method Based on Transmit Power Allocation*

**Contributor:** *Zhiyu Shen*

**Institution:** *University of Notre Dame*

## 2	Guidance

1. [Folder 0](https://github.com/Circuit-and-System-Intelligence/iSure-2022_Smart_Communication/tree/main/0_Documentations) stores the documents on basic knowledge and relevant derivation written by the researcher in carrying out the project.

2. [Folder 1](https://github.com/Circuit-and-System-Intelligence/iSure-2022_Smart_Communication/tree/main/1_Channel-Modeling) covers the code for channel modeling used in this project:

   Large scale fading: Okumura-Hata model

   Small scale fading: Rayleigh fading channel model

3. Folder 2 stores the codes computing Pearson Correlation Coefficients.

4. Folder 3 covers some of the conventional estimation method.

5. Folder 4 stores the codes for testing the Joint Estimator.

6. Folder 5 stores the codes for comparison between Joint Estimator and conventional estimation methods.

## 3	Documentation

A documentation on this project will soon be available.
