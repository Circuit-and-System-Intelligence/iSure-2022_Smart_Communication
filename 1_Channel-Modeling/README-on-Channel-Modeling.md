# Simple Channel Modeling

## 1	Introduction

The project models a simple wireless transmission channel and build up a whole digital communication system.

## 2	Fading Channel Model

### 2.1	General Description

The fading channel model is a combination of large-scale fading model and small-scale fading model. For large-scale fading, we adopt Okumura-Hata model and; For small-scale fading, we adopt Rayleigh fading channel model.

### 2.2	Okumura-Hata Model

Okumura-Hata model is adopted as the large-scale fading (path loss) model. It can be simply described by a formula
$$
PL = A + B\ log_{10}(d) + C \tag{2.2.1}
$$
where parameter A, B, C depends on various factors like $f_c,h_{BS},h_{MS},d$. Also, parameters vary at different application environment.

Function "HataPathLoss" is defined in the file "HataPathLoss.m".

File "HataModelCharacter.m" is used to test the model.

The path loss and path gain changes with the distance between base station and mobile as is described in the figure below.

### 2.3	Rayleigh Fading Channel Model

#### 2.3.1	General Description

The channel model can be described by the following graph

                padding: 2px;">Figure 2.3.1  Channel Model Frame</</div>
</center>

To simulate the channel in MATLAB, the model should be discretized and the channel impulse response $h_l(n)$ should cover the analog part including interpolation and  up-conversion. Thus, the fading channel coefficient can be written as
$$
h_l(n) = \sum\limits_i a_i(\frac{n}{F_s})\ e^{-j 2\pi f_c \tau_i(\frac{n}{F_s})}\ \mathrm{sinc}(l-\tau_i(\frac{n}{F_s})F_s) \tag{2.3.1}
$$

The derivation of the formula can be found in the document "Explanation for Transmission Formulas" Chapter 1 ~ 4.

Moreover, to simplify the modeling process, we temporarily consider the channel as a frequency nonselective one. In "Explanation for Transmission Formulas" Chapter 6, we have obtain the simplified baseband oriented channel model.

Function "RayleighFadingChannel" is defined in the file "RayleighFadingChannel.m".

File "RayleighChannCharacter.m" is used to test the model.

#### 2.3.2	Clarke Model and Jakes Method

The modeling process is a primary work for the tasks coming. So, we simply adopt Clarke Model here. Assume multipath wave at receiver evenly come from all direction.

The Rayleigh Fading Channel can then be modeled by Jakes Model in this project, where channel response is a complex Gaussian process and Gaussian distribution in both I and Q components are generated by sum of sinusoids.

                padding: 2px;">Figure 2.3.3  Implemention of Jakes Method</</div>

The formula can be expressed as
$$
\begin{align}
h_I(n) = 2\sum\limits_{n=1}^{N_0}(\mathrm{cos}\phi_n \mathrm{cos}\omega_n\frac{n}{F_s}) + \sqrt{2}\ \mathrm{cos}\phi_N \mathrm{cos}\omega_d\frac{n}{F_s} \\ \\
h_Q(n) = 2\sum\limits_{n=1}^{N_0}(\mathrm{sin}\phi_n \mathrm{cos}\omega_n\frac{n}{F_s}) + \sqrt{2}\ \mathrm{sin}\phi_N \mathrm{cos}\omega_d\frac{n}{F_s} \\ \\
\end{align} \tag{2.3.2}
$$
where $N_0$ represents the equivalent received rays at receiver, $\phi_n$ represents the initial phase of each received ray, $\omega_n$ represents the angular frequency of each received ray, $\omega_d$ represents the angular frequency of the ray that has the maximum doppler shift and $\phi_N$ represents its initial phase. Some of the parameters can be calculated as follow.
$$
\begin{align}
N_0 &= \frac{(N/2-1)}{2} \tag{2.3.3}\\ \\ 
\phi_n &= \frac{n\pi}{N_0+1}\quad n=1,2,\dots,N_0  \tag{2.3.4} \\ \\
\omega_n &= \omega_d \mathrm{cos}(2\pi n/N),\quad n=1,2,\dots,N_0 \tag{2.3.5} \\ \\
\phi_N &= 0 \tag{2.3.6} \\ \\
\omega_n &= 2\pi f_m \tag{2.3.7} \\ \\
f_m &= \frac{v}{f_c} = \frac{\lambda_c v}{c} \tag{2.3.8}
\end{align}
$$
where $N$ represents the total number of received rays at receiver, $f_m$ represents the maximum doppler shift, $f_c$ represents carrier wave frequency, $v$ represents the speed of mobile.

Thus, the complex channel impulse response can be written as
$$
h(n) = \frac{E}{\sqrt{2N_0+1}}\big[h_I(n)+jh_Q(n)\big] \tag{2.3.9}
$$
The program based on Jakes Method is tested by the test file and the result is shown below.

The fading channel coefficient's amplitude and angle changes with time as figure 2.3.4 displays.

The coefficients amplitude and angle distribution are consistent with theoretical ones as is shown in figure 2.3.5.
